# The Era to End All Eras
November 20th 2020. I made the decision to put Phoenix 5.x in beta testing.
I started to work on it on November 21st and it was made public the day after.
The Discord Server pre-maturely died on the 24th with warning and went back up on the 25th.

Everything you need to make your own versions of Phoenix, including but not limited to the installer file, external apps, and more.
